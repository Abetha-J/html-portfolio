<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an aspiring AI Product Designer passionate about creating seamless, human-centered digital experiences.
   With a growing foundation in UI/UX design and front-end development, I’ve started bringing ideas to life by building
    websites using HTML — and I’m excited to keep evolving from static pages to smart, interactive systems.</p>

  My interest lies in blending design with emerging technologies like AI to craft interfaces that are not only functional 
  but intuitive and future-ready. I approach design with empathy, curiosity, and a strong desire to make tech more accessible
   and meaningful for people.</p>
  
  As I continue to upskill in design systems, user psychology, and intelligent interfaces, I'm on a mission to design products 
  that are both aesthetically engaging and powered by purpose-driven innovation.</p>
